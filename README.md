# CodePipeline Radiator

Has your CodePipeline builds ever been broken for multiple days because the status of those pipes weren't visible somewhere all the time? ðŸ˜¢

With CodePipeline Radiator you can see the status of all project pipes you wan't to track. Everything at a glance! ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘€

## How to configure

__Note!__ Configration is subject to change as the radiator is currently being switched to Lambda, which in turn uses IAM roles

1. Create `server/.env` file by copying `server/.env-example` to `server/.env` (`cp server/.env.example server/.env`)
2. Set the `AWS_REGION` with the desired region in `.env` file or environment variable
3. Auth either using `aws-cli` or create IAM user with access to CodePipeline and set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to `.env` file or environment variables

Example `.env` file

```bash
HTTP_PORT=80
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=someRandomStringHereGeneratedByAWS
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=someRandomStringHereGeneratedByAWS
```

## Usage

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build of the radiator
2. Run `npm start` to start the server
3. Open `http://localhost` and set the CodePipeline name to the `q` url param (fe. `http://localhost?q=my-fantastic-codepipeline`)
4. Enjoy your new visibility to AWS CodePipeline ðŸ“º!

## Development

1. Setup configurations (see above)
2. Install common modules (`npm install`)
3. Install server modules (`cd server`, `npm install`)
4. Install client modules (`cd client`, `npm install`)
5. Start server in development mode (`cd server`, `npm run dev`)
6. Start client in development mode (`cd client`, `npm run dev`)
